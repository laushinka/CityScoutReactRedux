# React Bootstrap Slider

##Overview
A ReactJS wrapper [seiyria's Bootstrap Slider component](https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider)


##Background
Note: This project is a split off from my [react-bootstrap-native-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap-native-slider) plugin.  The plan is for the react-bootstrap-slider to become a dependency of react-bootstrap-native-slider, rather than have all the code bundled into the latter, as at present.


##How to use
Install from npm with:

    npm install --save react-bootstrap-slider

Require or import like so for ES6:

    import ReactBootstrapSlider from 'react-bootstrap-slider';

or like this for CommonJS:

    var ReactBootstrapSlider = require("react-bootstrap-slider");


The control is implemented in UMD format, so should also work for AMD/RequireJS, but I've not tested that.  You can also add it as a script tag.


Here's an example of how you might call it in your ReactJS's render method:

```JavaScript
<ReactBootstrapSlider
    value={this.state.currentValue}
    handleChange={this.changeValue}
    step={this.state.step}
    max={this.state.max}
    min={this.state.min}
    orientation="vertical"
    reverse={true}
    disabled="disabled" />
    }
```

The **value**, **step**, **max** and **min** parameters should be self-explanatory.  handleChange is the callback method that will be called when the slider actually changes.  (NB: this is the "change" event for the Bootstrap slider.)

If the optional parameter **disabled** is included, and is set to "disabled", then the slider will display in a disabled state.  If the parameter is not included, or is set to anything else except "disabled", then the slider control will be enabled.

The default **orientation** value is 'horizontal', so you only need to include that prop if you want to set it to 'vertical'.

If **value** is a two member array, then the slider will have two handles: minimum and maximum.  You should also pass win a **range** parameter set to true in this case.

As of version 1.0.5, other values passed into the component will also passed into the underlying bootstrap-slider component via the [Object Spread Operator that's been proposed for ES2017](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/7617) (yes, that's how cutting edge I am!!).  See [seyria's documentation](https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider) for a full list of these.  Those parameters have not all been tested yet but the `reverse` parameter definitely works, and I have included this in the demo of the vertical slider.

Version 1.0.6 fixed an issue that prevented ticks props from being rendered.  Pass in ticks props like so:

```JavaScript
          ticks = {[0, 100, 200, 300, 400]}
          ticks_labels = {["$0", "$100", "$200", "$300", "$400"]}
          ticks_snap_bounds = { 30 }
```


##Development
To develop, issue this command:

    npm run start

then point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/src/index.html](http://localhost:8080/src/index.html).  You need to edit the code in the /src folder.  It will update in the browser automatically, courtesy of webpack-dev-server.

To build the distribution version, issue:

    npm run build

The build JavaScript file will go on the /dist folder as react-bootstrap-slider.js.  This is the main file for the project, which is used whenever this the react-bootstrap-slider package is loaded from npm.


##Demo
There is a /demo folder present, but it only contains index.html and the CSS files by default.  The JavaScript files need to be built before you can run this demo.  If there is no /demo/js folder present, then you need to run:

        npm run buildDemo

Webpack will build the JavaScript files for the demo and put them in the /demo/js/ folder.  Demo code will go in the /demo/js/slider-bundle.min.js file.  Any 3rd-party code (jQuery, Bootstrap and the react-bootstrap-slider itself) goes into the /demo/js/vendor.min.js file.  Source maps are generated both.

CSS files and the index.html file will be copied from the /src folder to the /demo folder, with the correct script tag reference being inserted into index.html.  You can then open /demo/index.html in your browser from the local server.  To run that local server, issue the command:

        npm run localServer

This will launch http-server running on port 8082, so you can then open the built demo from http://localhost:8082/demo/index.html.


##Tests
There are no unit tests.

End to end (E2E) tests are handled by Protractor with Selenium Web Driver.


###Installing Tests Dependencies
Before running the E2E tests, you'll need to install the web driver first by running:

        npm run updateSelenium

You only have to do this once though.


###Running Tests Against Dev Version
The same set of tests can be run against either the Dev version or the built version of the Demo.  To run run tests against the development version of the Demo, you need to run:

        npm run testDev

This assumes that you already have webpack-dev-server running on port 8080, via an `npm run start` command.  So putting that all together, the full commands to run the Dev tests would be:

        npm run updateSelenium
        npm run start
        npm run testDev

Note: the latter command will need to be run in a separate terminal window/tab, because the first terminal will be tied up with running webpack-dev-server.


###Running Tests Against Built Version
To run tests against the built version, you obviously need to build that version first!  You then need a server running on port 8082, before finally running the tests in a new terminal window/tab.  The commands to do all of this would be:

         npm run buildDemo
         npm run localServer
         npm run testBuild


###Test Results & Reports
Test results will be displayed in whichever terminal to your the `npm run testBuild` or `npm run testDev` commands.

The tests will also generate HTML reports in the /reports folder, courtesy of the [protractor-jasmine2-screenshot-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor-jasmine2-screenshot-reporter) package.  Open the /reports/index.html file in a browser to see them.  Note how each test result in this report is a URL.  If you click on the URL, it will take you to a screenshot of how the browser looked when that particular test ran, which is pretty neat, IMHO!



###Editing Tests
The tests themselves are in the file tests/e2e/slidertest1.js.  The tests check:

1. The page loads with the correct default values set for both the vertical and horizontal versions of the Demo.
1. Dragging the horizontal slider to the right increases its value correctly
1. Dragging the vertical slider upwards increases its value correctly
1. Clicking on the Change Axes button for both demos changes each one's respective default value correctly.

There's a Protractor Tutorial at http://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial, and the the Protractor API is at http://www.protractortest.org/#/api.

###Further Test Configs
Protractor defaults to using the Firefox browser, so make sure that you have it installed!  Or if you want to use Chrome or even IE, then you'll need to make some modifications to the protractor.local.conf.js file.  Google for how to do that.

Whatever other changes you make to protractor.local.conf.js, you _must_ _not_ remove this line:

        browser.ignoreSynchronization = true;

Protractor is actually a testing tool designed for AngularJS, and by default, it will wait for Angular models to send their update messages before proceeding onto the next test.  This line tells Protractor not to wait for any such messages, which, of course, won't be coming because you're not using Angular, sensible person that you are!


##Update History
Version 1.0.6: 1 August 2016.
* Fixed issue where ticks props were not being rendered.  This is because the code was assuming that there would always be min and max props, but the ticks props actually override these.

Version 1.0.5: 13 June 2016.
* Explained how use dual slider controls.  Added test for same.
* Cleaned up demo to code to have one Demo class instead of three.

Version 1.0.4: 12 June 2016.
* Added vertical slider to demo page.
* Updated build process to copy (and update) CSS and HTML files from /src to /demo folder using Gulp.  So no longer have to update the /demo files manually when updating build.
* Added test suite using Protractor/Selenium.

Version 1.0.3: 7 June 2016.
* Fixed path issues in package.json scripts.
* Removed postInstall step from package.json, as not actually required.
